## Introduction/Overview/Executive Summary

Oil is an important commodity.  Some of our planet's inhabitants produce it.  Many more consume it. All are affected by it.  Because of its wide-ranging effects, oil commands collective attention enabled by analysis. One of the key metrics to take into account in the analysis of the oil indutry is the daily closing price of crude oil futures traded on a global basis in such venues as the New York Mercantile Exchange. 

Methods for predicting that price may entail studying the quantitative and qualitative factors at play inside the oil industry as well as in such adjacent industries as transportation and manufacturing. They may also entail studying the often complex diplomatic, military, economic, cultural, and environmental developments that help explain why crude oil closing prices rise and fall as they do over time. 

This project proposes a simpler method, one that predicts crude oil closing prices based on time and the closing prices of complementary (e.g., gasoline) and competing (e.g., platinum) commodities. The premise is that there is much to be learned by studying the behaviors of commodity traders engaged in making daily investment decisions based on running evaluations of risks and rewards. 

That premise informed the development of algorithms with the potential to predict crude oil closing prices with a viable level of accuracy, quantified as the Root Means Square Error (RMSE). Using a 25,190-row data set constructed with publicly available information downloaded for free from https://www.nasdaq.com/, the author developed and then evaluated fifteen such algorithms.

Evaluation led to the selection of one algorithm that generated the lowest RMSE when applied to a test set. That algorithm used a Ranger model which took into account six key predictors:

(1) Year
(2) Month 
(3) Closing Price of Heating Oil
(4) Closing Price of Gasoline
(5) Closing Price of Platinum
(6) Closing Price of Soybeans

The RMSE in question was 2.93, a figure equating to a mere 12% of the 23.51 generated by an algorithm that only took into account the average closing price across the period of observation.

### Then, it mutates the resulting data set in way that will enable the envisioned analysis
### Next, it saves that data frame into a .RDATA data set under the RDA subdirectory

### This section evaluates a set of fifteen potentially viable algorithms for predicting cruide oil closing prices

### Each of the first nine algorithms considers crude oil in isolation from other globally traded commodities
### In isolation, the available predictors include both the cyclical and the linear components of time
### One cyclical component is each observation's day of the trading week (Monday, Tuesday,...Friday)
### Others are the month (1,2..12) and the quarter (1,2,..4) of each year on the 2010-2020 timeline
### Liner components are the year (e.g., 2010) and month (e.g., 8/2010) of each observation

#### ALGORITHM 01 (AVERAGE)

##### This algorithm predicts crude oil closing prices based solely on the average crude oil price for 2010-2020
##### It will serve as a baseline from which to compare the analytical viability of other, more sophisticated algorithms

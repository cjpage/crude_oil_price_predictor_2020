r### This script evaluates a second series of potentially viable algorithms for predicting cruide oil closing prices
### Each of these algorithms considers crude oil in comparison to other commodities from the energy, precious metals, and agriculture sector
### The predictors include not only time but the closing prices of natural gas, heating oil, gasoline, gold, silver, platinum, wheat, oil, and soybeans

### Algorithm 07: Predicted Crude Oil Price Based on Random Forest of Time and Energy Effects

#### The first step is to look at a random forest incorporating the key time components plus natural gas, heating oil, and gasoline

rf = randomForest(closing_price ~ date_year + 
                    date_month + 
                    natural_gas_closing_price + 
                    heating_oil_closing_price + 
                    gasoline_closing_price, data = crude_oil_train)

##### The second is to build a plot to help determine which of those components is/are the most important predictors

varImpPlot(rf)

###### Based on that plot, random forest will be revised to focus on gasoline, heating oil, year, and natural gas effects

rf = randomForest(closing_price ~ 
                    gasoline_closing_price +
                    heating_oil_closing_price +
                    date_year + 
                    natural_gas_closing_price, data = crude_oil_train)

####### That revised random forest is the basis of the seventh algorithm in this series

pred <- predict(rf, newdata = crude_oil_train)
RMSE(pred, crude_oil_train$closing_price)

predicted_price_algorithm_07 <- predict(rf, newdata = crude_oil_test)
RMSE07 <- RMSE(predicted_price_algorithm_07, crude_oil_test$closing_price)

### Algorithm 08: Predicted Crude Oil Price Based on Random Forest of Time, Energy, and Precious Metal Effects

#### The first step is to look at a random forest incorporating the key time and energy components plus gold, silver, and platinum

                    heating_oil_closing_price +
                    date_year +
                    gasoline_closing_price +
                    silver_closing_price, data = crude_oil_train)

####### That revised random forest is the basis of the eighth algorithm in this series

pred <- predict(rf, newdata = crude_oil_train)
RMSE(pred, crude_oil_train$closing_price)

predicted_price_algorithm_08 <- predict(rf, newdata = crude_oil_test)

#### The first step is to look at a random forest incorporating the key time, energy, and precious metal components plus wheat, rice, and soybeans

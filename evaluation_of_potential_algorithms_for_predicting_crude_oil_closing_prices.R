### This section evaluates a set of fifteen potentially viable algorithms for predicting cruide oil closing prices

### Each of the first nine algorithms considers crude oil in isolation from other globally traded commodities
### In isolation, the available predictors include both the cyclical and the linear components of time
### One cyclical component is each observation's day of the trading week (Monday, Tuesday,...Friday)
### Others are the month (1,2..12) and the quarter (1,2,..4) of each year on the 2010-2020 timeline
### Liner components are the year (e.g., 2010) and month (e.g., 8/2010) of each observation

#### ALGORITHM 01 (AVERAGE)

##### This algorithm predicts crude oil closing prices based solely on the average crude oil price for 2010-2020
##### It will serve as a baseline from which to compare the analytical viability of other, more sophisticated algorithms
